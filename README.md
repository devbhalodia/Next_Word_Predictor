# Next_Word_Predictor
This is a Streamlit-based Next Word Prediction app that uses a deep learning model to generate text predictions. Users can enter a phrase and specify the number of words they want to predict, and the model will generate the next words accordingly.

# Features
- Predicts the next words based on the given input text.
- Allows users to specify the number of words to predict.
- Uses a trained deep learning model and tokenizer for text generation.
- Simple and interactive user interface built with Streamlit.

# Requirements
- TensorFlow
- Streamlit
- NumPy
- Pickle

# Usage
1. Run the Streamlit app.
2. Enter a starting phrase in the input field.
3. Choose the number of words to predict.
4. Click the Predict button to generate the text.

# Setup Instructions
- Install the required dependencies.
- Ensure that the trained model (saved model) and tokenizer (tokenizer.pkl) are present in the project directory.
- Run the Streamlit app using the appropriate command.
